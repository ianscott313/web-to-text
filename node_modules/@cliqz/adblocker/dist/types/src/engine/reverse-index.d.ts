/**
 * The ReverseIndex is an accelerating data structure which allows finding a
 * subset of the filters given a list of tokens seen in a URL. It is the core
 * of the adblocker's matching capabilities and speed.
 *
 * It has mainly two caracteristics:
 * 1. It is very compact and is able to load fast.
 * 2. It is *very fast* in finding potential candidates.
 *
 * Conceptually, the reverse index dispatches filters in "buckets" (an array of
 * one or more filters). Filters living in the same bucket are guaranteed to
 * share at least one of their tokens (appearing in the pattern). For example:
 *
 *   - Bucket 1 (ads):
 *       - /ads.js
 *       - /script/ads/tracking.js
 *       - /ads/
 *   - Bucket 2 (tracking)
 *       - /tracking.js
 *       - ||tracking.com/cdn
 *
 * We see that filters in "Bucket 1" are indexed using the token "ads" and
 * "Bucket 2" using token "tracking".
 *
 * This property allows to quickly discard most of the filters when we match a
 * URL. To achieve this, the URL is tokenized in the same way filters are
 * tokenized and for each token, we check if there are some filters available.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *  URL "https://tracking.com/" has the following tokens: "https", "tracking"
 *  and "com". We immediatly see that we only check the two filters in the
 *  "tracking" bucket since they are the only ones having a common token with
 *  the URL.
 *
 * How do we pick the token for each filter?
 * =========================================
 *
 * Each filter is only indexed *once*, which means that we need to pick one of
 * the tokens appearing in the pattern. We choose the token such that each
 * filter is indexed using the token which was the *least seen* globally. In
 * other words, we pick the most discriminative token for each filter. This is
 * done using the following algorithm:
 *   1. Tokenize all the filters which will be stored in the index
 *   2. Compute a histogram of frequency of each token (globally)
 *   3. Select the best token for each filter (lowest frequency)
